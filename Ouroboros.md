Stuck in the cycle of the serpent <br>
With a band of market-driven merchants <br>
Meeting the ends, of that we're certain <br>
Of the means, always observant <br>

All our information is current <br>
With our opinions we're conversant <br>
Art and science, form an adjunction <br>
Question every known assumption <br>

Opportunities lead to excursions <br>
Asymmetries, we uncurtain <br>
Manage risk and take diversions <br>
Capitalise on the uncertain <br>

Collect the dots in reversion <br>
Connect the dots through recursion <br>
Driven by value realisation <br>
Solving the serpentine equation.
